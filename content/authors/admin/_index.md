I am an Assistant Professor of Statistics at [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu/) in the [Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science](https://www.macalester.edu/mscs/). I love using statistics to learn about biology and human health. Methodologically, I have a particular passion for looking at data from high-throughput technologies and using causal inference and graph-based tools. Besides health and biology, I also have interests in human-data interaction: the investigation of how humans interact with data in ways that impact analysis, understanding, and scientific communication. I am also quite excited about creating tools that help people organize and explore large amounts of interconnected information.

I received my PhD in [biostatistics](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/) from the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu/) where I worked with [Kasper Daniel Hansen](http://www.hansenlab.org/) on statistical methodology for high-throughput biology and with [Jeff Leek](http://jtleek.com/) and [Leah Jager](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/2909/leah-r-jager) on understanding the role of human behavior in data analysis.

My last name is pronounced **mee-int**. A common mispronunciation that is quite understandable given the spelling is my-int. While this can be amusing from a computer science perspective, it is, nevertheless, incorrect!
