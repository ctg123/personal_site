I am an avid [Dungeons and Dragons](http://dnd.wizards.com/) player and game enthusiast, and I love finding ways to bring coding and analysis into these beloved hobbies of mine. As a result, I have a few side projects devoted entirely to fun!

- [Map Annotator](https://github.com/lmyint/rdnd): A Shiny app that I developed to create clickable annotated maps for helping game masters keep track of details in information-dense areas.
- [R + Magic the Gathering](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zdMStQLOJUIpmVQZv9VxwYYTyp1nFHgorwQzYrgA1Uo/edit?usp=sharing): (Slides) A foray into the [rvest](https://github.com/hadley/rvest) package in R with an application for organizing information about Magic the Gathering decklists.
